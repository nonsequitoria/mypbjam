<p class="italic font-bold">When You Were New</p>

<p>(illus. Lenny Wen; HarperCollins 2023)</p>

<p>"The everyday moments, aside from a beach visit and car trip, are low or no cost, offering reminders of how the most special memories can stem from the ordinary. Relaxed reading on the couch, tea parties, and picnics are the treasures here. Soft illustrations in a warm palette, portraying only the parents, child, and dog, give an intimate depiction of this tightknit family and their loving bonds."â€•<i><a href="https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/jennifer-harris/when-you-were-new/">Kirkus Reviews</a></i></p>
