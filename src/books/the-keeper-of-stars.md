<p class="italic font-bold mb-1 text-xl">The Keeper of Stars</p>

<p>(illus. Dorothy Leung; OwlKids 2024)</p>

<p>Every night after his mom tucks him in, Milo travels far above the clouds to help the Keeper of Stars. After a long day, there’s lots to clean up in the sky. Together, Milo and the Keeper of Stars gather up stray balloons and feathers and rinse and polish the stars (which would be easier if they weren’t so ticklish!). When everything is tidy, the two hard workers admire the millions of bright twinkles in the night sky before Milo heads back to his room and slides into bed, careful not to wake his mom.</p>
