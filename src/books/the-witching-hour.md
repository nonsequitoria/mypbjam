<p class="italic font-bold mb-1 text-xl">The Witching Hour</p>

<p>(illus. Adelina Lirius; Tundra / Penguin Random House, June 2025)</p>

In the witching hour between dinner and bedtime, anything can happen: laughter, tears, fun screaming, not-fun screaming . . . parents, siblings, pets and neighbors are all familiar with this dreaded time of day.

What happens when that cranky baby is part of a family of witches?

Turns out, it's pretty much the same, except sometimes the toys levitate and the soothing songs sound a little different ...

The Witching Hour is a spare, slyly funny and deeply familiar slice-of-life story featuring a fussy little witch and their increasingly desperate family.

<p>“A spot-on rendering of the magical lengths families will go to soothe a cranky witchling.”
</br> - <i>Brunhilda Stormweary, The Witchling Sleep Solution</i></p>

 <p>“They try everything! Broomsticks! Conjuring! Everything except my patented frog’s eye potion, which can be ordered directly through my cat, Ms. Saucytail.” 
</br> - <i>Dr. Spider, author of Dr. Spider’s Witchling Basics</i></p>

 <p>“Non-magic parents sorely lack our advantages—how do they manage?” 
</br> - <i>Hepzibah Newton, Advice and Spells for the New Witch Parent</i></p>
