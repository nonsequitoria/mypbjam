<p class="italic font-bold mb-1 text-xl">The Witching Hour</p>

<p>(illus. Adelina Lirius; Tundra / Penguin Random House, June 2025)</p>

In the witching hour between dinner and bedtime, anything can happen: laughter, tears, fun screaming, not-fun screaming . . . parents, siblings, pets and neighbors are all familiar with this dreaded time of day. What happens when that cranky baby is part of a family of witches? Turns out, it's pretty much the same, except sometimes the toys levitate and the soothing songs sound a little different ... The Witching Hour is a spare, slyly funny and deeply familiar slice-of-life story featuring a fussy little witch and their increasingly desperate family.
