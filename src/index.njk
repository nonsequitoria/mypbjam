    <p>"This lively portrayal of the girls and their mother sparkles with curiosity and joy; it's sure to inspire questions in young listeners as it embraces feminism, history, creativity, and science. An engaging inquiry into the lives of everyday girls who are limited by historical circumstance but yearn for more."―<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p>
    <p>"Through Harris’s imagination, and the illustrations by Louise Pigott, we are taken into the world of three young daughters growing up under all the constraints placed on girls at the time, but with a mother who encourages them to explore and appreciate the world around them, and beyond." ―<i>Canadian Quilter</i></p>
