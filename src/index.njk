    <span style="color: #684709" class="font-thin whitespace-nowrap text-3xl lg:text-2xl">Jennifer Harris.</span>
    <p>I'm a writer of picture books, and a reader of everything.</p>

    {# I also really like chocolate, my family, and bookstores. Usually, I'm in Waterloo, Ontario, where I'm also an English professor, and where we live in a little storybook house. #}
